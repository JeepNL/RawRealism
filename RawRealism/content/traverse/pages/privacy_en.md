This site uses no cookies, no tracking, and no analytics.

I don’t want to know who you are, where you’re from, or what you do after visiting. Your visit is your business. Period.

This site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, which means Cloudflare can technically see your IP address when you visit. I don’t have access to that information, and I don’t use it in any way.

There’s no contact form, no newsletter, no like button, no hidden scripts. What you see is what you get.

If I ever change this privacy statement, I’ll update it right here — clearly and without fine print.

Thanks for stopping by.

— Jaap
