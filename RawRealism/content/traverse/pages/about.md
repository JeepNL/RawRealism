Fast forward to 2024: Trump gets re-elected. No words — except maybe: insane.

But no, U.S. politics isn’t the only reason for this blog.

Here in the Netherlands, we now have a far-right Speaker of the House (Martin Bosma), and as of June 2025, the far-right Schoof cabinet has just collapsed.

There are already enough people in the world — especially on social media — who know exactly how things are and preach their ‘absolute truth’ to their followers every single day. That’s not what I want to do here.

This blog isn’t about convincing anyone. It’s about sharing my thoughts. Raw. Personal. Unfiltered.

I use this blog to write the shit off my chest. A pressure valve. I hope it helps me feel better and deal more calmly with the world we live in.

And if it helps you too — then that’s just a bonus.

## Edward Hopper

I’m not really into art. I like something or I don’t — I don’t usually care to analyze why.

But Edward Hopper’s work? I like it. A lot.

The first time I saw one of his paintings, I immediately started imagining what it meant. His work tells stories — or sparks them. His style speaks to me. And that’s rare when it comes to art.

On this blog, I use AI-generated illustrations inspired by what I call “Edward Hopper Realism.”

And what’s this blog called again?

## AI

Besides the illustrations, I also run my texts through AI — for spelling, grammar, tone.

So yes, I use AI. But the words are mine. My ideas. My writing.

I blog in both Dutch and English. My English is decent, but if you’re reading an English post, it’s usually an AI-assisted translation of the original Dutch version.

## Blog software

No WordPress. No CMS.

Everything you see here — I built it myself.

Because I enjoy it. And because programming is a creative outlet for me too.

Yes, programmers are creatives. Artists even — no less than potters or stage actors.
