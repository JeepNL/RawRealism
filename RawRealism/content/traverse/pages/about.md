I write because I feel a need for something: for nuance, for silence in the noise, for something that is real. I don't need to be right. But I do want to be real.

Many blogs try to keep visitors engaged, to steer them, or to entice them. This blog does not do that. No tracking, no ads, no tricks. What you see is what it is.

And why did I build this myself, without WordPress or other systems? Because I can. Because I want to understand how it works. Because I like being independent.

This place is mine — and if you find something valuable here, that only makes it more worthwhile.
