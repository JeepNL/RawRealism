IDE is Visual Studio 2026 Insiders with always the very latest Preview.

I'm using .NET 10 Preview SDK and C# 14 for my projects.

I always use the latest versions of Nuget / Github libraries and repos.

Please don't use deprecated or obsolete code from repos and libraries.

When showing code samples or code changes, only show the parts that have changed or the parts that have been added. You don't need to show all of the existing code.
