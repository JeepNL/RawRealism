I'm Jaap and I'm Dutch, but I'm asking my questions in English and you can respond in English too. Sometimes I don't know the exact or technical English words for C# terms, and I'll try to describe it. If I don't use the correct terms, please don't copy my input or repeat my words, but use the correct terms or expressions yourself. I will understand them, and it teaches me the new vocabulary.

My IDE is Visual Studio 2022 with always the very latest Preview.

I'm using .NET 10 Preview SDK and C# 14 for my projects.

I always use the latest versions of Nuget / Github libraries and repos.

Please don't use deprecated or obsolete code from repos and libraries.

When showing code samples or code changes, only show the parts that have changed or the parts that have been added. You don't need to show all of the existing code.
