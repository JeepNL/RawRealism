<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>When Trump was elected president of the United States in 2016, it came as a shock to me. I honestly thought Hillary would win. I still remember waking up and hearing the news — it felt like a punch in the gut. How could this happen? A male chauvinist pig and a loose cannon as president? Had the Americans lost their minds?</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2024: Trump gets re-elected. No words — except maybe: insane.</p>
<p>But no, U.S. politics isn’t the only reason for this blog.</p>
<p>Here in the Netherlands, we now have a far-right Speaker of the House (Martin Bosma), and as of June 2025, the far-right Schoof cabinet has just collapsed.</p>
<p>There are already enough people in the world — especially on social media — who know exactly how things are and preach their ‘absolute truth’ to their followers every single day. That’s not what I want to do here.</p>
<p>This blog isn’t about convincing anyone. It’s about sharing my thoughts. Raw. Personal. Unfiltered.</p>
<p>I use this blog to write the shit off my chest. A pressure valve. I hope it helps me feel better and deal more calmly with the world we live in.</p>
<p>And if it helps you too — then that’s just a bonus.</p>
<h2>Edward Hopper</h2>
<p>I’m not really into art. I like something or I don’t — I don’t usually care to analyze why.</p>
<p>But Edward Hopper’s work? I like it. A lot.</p>
<p>The first time I saw one of his paintings, I immediately started imagining what it meant. His work tells stories — or sparks them. His style speaks to me. And that’s rare when it comes to art.</p>
<p>On this blog, I use AI-generated illustrations inspired by what I call “Edward Hopper Realism.”</p>
<p>And what’s this blog called again?</p>
<h2>AI</h2>
<p>Besides the illustrations, I also run my texts through AI — for spelling, grammar, tone.</p>
<p>So yes, I use AI. But the words are mine. My ideas. My writing.</p>
<p>I blog in both Dutch and English. My English is decent, but if you’re reading an English post, it’s usually an AI-assisted translation of the original Dutch version.</p>
<h2>Blog software</h2>
<p>No WordPress. No CMS.</p>
<p>Everything you see here — I built it myself.</p>
<p>Because I enjoy it. And because programming is a creative outlet for me too.</p>
<p>Yes, programmers are creatives. Artists even — no less than potters or stage actors.</p>
